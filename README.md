# Hi, I'm Fedor
Software engineer based in Saint Petersburg.

I build web applications of any scale and offer architectural guidance when needed.  

Feel free to reach out – I’m open to suggestions!

My main tech stack is TypeScript and React. To evaluate my current skills, you can check out my recent work [repository](https://github.com/atlz253/1880835-six-cities-6).

**Fun facts**:
